[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/fp-ethereum/fp-ethereum.png)](https://gitter.im/fp-ethereum/Lobby)

A community of functional programming enthusiasts who are interested in bringing functional programming to the Ethereum platform.

**Topics of interest:**

- Creating a Haskell-like language for the EVM
- Creating a Lisp-like language for the EVM
- Using dependent types to provide formal verification of smart contracts.

Please join us on the [fp-ethereum](https://gitter.im/fp-ethereum/Lobby) gitter channel for all things FP+ETH: [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/fp-ethereum/fp-ethereum.png)](https://gitter.im/fp-ethereum/Lobby)
